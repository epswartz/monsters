# monsters
A tool for scraping r/monsteraday and digesting the data.

Eventually, the goal is:
1. Scrape through r/monsteraday
2. Pick up posts
3. Create JSON with the CR, name, and type of the monster
4. Pile it all into a nice HTML page with some filtering that I can put up on GitHub pages

Right now working on getting the CR out of an image - see the stuff in resources dir.
