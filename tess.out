GrrHyANErI MINDRAIDERS

While not as martally potent as githyank knights, githyankl
indraiders are versitile servants for the the Lich Queen.
hey inves ttle time in learning the ways of a wartior and
focus primarily on sharpening their psionic powers to access
the minds offoes. As a result, they're just as likely to act as
spies and courtroom manipulators as lead ruthless
incursions to steal resources and mentally enslave victims,

Mindraiders are especially adept at making quick strikes
{nto the Prime Material to gather slaves. Small warhands
hhave been known to depopulate towns or, given enough time,
centre regions. However, before starting a full fledged raid,
they scout out theirtarget by dominating a local to examine
defenses and probe for weaknesses.

Githyanki mindraiders gain significant advanatages when
paired with a dominated humanoid The second set of eves
‘makes them harder to surprise, and the risk of harming an
innocent isa powerful defense against would be heroes. This
is why whenever they enter combat they have a dominated
slave by their side ~or they quiclly acquire one!

Grryanxr LICHBLADE

GGithyuanki lichblades have made a soulpact with the Lich-
(Queen to help her obtain her goal of becoming a god She
ifives them a fragment of her power to strengthen them in
battle and bolster other gthyanki. This connection makes
lichblades the closest thing that the githyanki have to a
priestly warrior It also gives them status to go wherever they
please without being challenged. They can join any gathering
for accompany any githyanki raiding party acting as the eyes:
land ears ofthe Lich-Queen,

However, their powers arent limited to simple spells and
social standing. The soul-pact allows them to feed the Lich-
‘Queen's hunger for power. Lichblades are wreathed in a
{frightful void that consumes the souls ofthe fallen (friend and
foe alike) and shattered divine magic. This aura of anguish
‘makes them a direct conduit to their patron. This is why they
‘hunger for slaughter and will go out oftheir way to target
those that use divine magic. Disrupting divine spells and.
slaying devotees of the divine are greatest sacrifices they can
offer their queen.

‘Their role and powers make them universally eared
‘amongst their kin. Standing next toa lichblade is almost.
‘universally avoided All know that dying next to one isa
terrible fate. The soul travels to Tinarath, where the Lich-
(Queen awaits, Unfortunately for githyanki, that's the fate that
awaits them anyway.

Innate Spellcastng (Psionis). The githyank's innate
spelleasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6
‘to hit with spell attacks). It ¢an nately cast the
following spells, requiring no components:

sgreatsword.

‘Stier Greatsword Melee Weapon Attack: +11 t0 hit,
teach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 14 (2d6+7) slashing
damage plus 10 (346) psychic damage. This is a magic
‘weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an
astral body (as with the astral projection spel), the
githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target
‘o its material body, instead of dealing damage.

GITHYANKI

Ancient Alliance. When the legendary Gith made a pact with
Tiamat and Ephelomon, Tiamat's red dragon consort, the
githyanki were given the Scepter of Ephelomon and red
dragon allies. The proud dragons would serve the githyanki
as mounts in exchange for the githyanki aiding Tiamat
whenever she called upon them. Vlaakith I, whom Gith had
designated as her successor, received the magical scepter
and each githyanki queen has wielded it and controlled the
red dragons under its dominion ever since.

GITHYANKI DUTHKA'GITH

Over the eons since the githyanki formed their pact with the

Queen of Evil Dragons, their knowledge of their allies have
only increased. Several githyanki queens have experimented
with ways to leverage this for additional power. Based on
these experiments and centuries of study, the Lich-Queen,
Vlaakith the CLVII, leveraged the power of the scepter and
created the duthka'gith, powerful githyanki warriors infused
with the blood of red dragons. More powerful than a simple
hybrid or hlaf-dragon, they were crafted with the power of the
Nine Hells. These soldiers, though limited in number, pleased
Vlaakith so much that they now serve her as her personal
guard or as shock troops for particularly important missions.

Aura of Ephelomon. Any creature of the githyanki's

choice that is within 30 feet of the githyanki and aware

of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw

or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can

repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,

ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's

saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the

creature is immune to the githyanki's Aura of

Ephelomon for the next 24 hours.

Brute. A melee weapon deals one extra die of its
damage when the githyanki hits with it (included in the
attack).
